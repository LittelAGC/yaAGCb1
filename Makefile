# Copyright:	Public Domain
# Filename:	Makefile
# Purpose:	Build my (Ron Burkey) Block 1 AGC simulator.
# Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Pultorak.html
# Mod history:	2016-09-03 RSB	Began
#		2016-11-18 RSB	Explicitly include socket library in Solaris.
#		2017-08-22 RSB	Correct path to yaYUL, which apparently reflected
#				my original setup, in which yaAGCb1 was separate
#				from virtualagc, rather than appearing under it.
#				The path worked okay, but only as long as the
#				top-level directory was named "virtualagc".
